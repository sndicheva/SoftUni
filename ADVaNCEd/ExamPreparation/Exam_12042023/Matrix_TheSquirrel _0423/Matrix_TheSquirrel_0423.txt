02. The Squirrel
 
An intern from a big company must solve the game - "The squirrel". He doesn’t have enough experience, so he needs your help.
Here are the rules of the game:
The game starts with 0 collected hazelnuts. Your goal is to collect all of them.
You get as input the size of the field, which will be always a square shape. After that, you will receive the directions in which the squirrel can move – "left", "right", "down", and "up" in a sequence, each value separated by a comma and a space (", "). On the next rows, you will receive the field.
Possible characters in the field:
•	s - represents the squirrel's position.
•	h – represents a hazelnut. 
•	* – the asterisk represents an empty position.
•	t – represents a trap.
The squirrel starts from the s - position.
•	If the squirrel steps on a hazelnut, you have to increase them by 1. You have to track the number of hazelnuts because you may need them. The field should be marked with an asterisk (*).
o	If the squirrel collects all 3 hazelnuts, the game ends and the squirrel stays in its last position.
•	Asterisk ("*") does nothing, so nothing happens if the squirrel steps on it.
•	If it steps on a trap, the game ends and the squirrel disappears from the screen.
•	If the squirrel moves out of the field, the game ends and disappears from the screen.
After all commands you will have 4 possible results:
•	You win if the squirrel collects all of the hazelnuts.
•	The squirrel has collected less than 3 hazelnuts.
•	The squirrel steps on a trap.
•	The squirrel moves out of the field.
Input
•	On the first line, you will receive the length of the field – an integer number in the range [3, 5].
•	On the second line, you will receive the commands to move the squirrel – an array of strings separated by ", ".
•	In the next N lines, you will receive the values for every row.
Output
•	On the first line:
o	If the squirrel goes out of the field - "The squirrel is out of the field.".
o	If the squirrel steps on a trap - "Unfortunately, the squirrel stepped on a trap...".
o	If the squirrel hasn’t collected all hazelnuts - "There are more hazelnuts to collect.".
o	If the squirrel has collected all hazelnuts - "Good job! You have collected all hazelnuts!".
•	On the second line, print the number of collected hazelnuts - "Hazelnuts collected: {hazelnuts_count}"
Constraints
•	The size of the field will be between [3,5].
•	There could be one or no trap on the field.
•	There will always be 3 hazelnuts on the field.
