03. Clothing Magazine
 
You are an appraiser and you have to audit clothing magazines. Let's get started!
1.	Preparation
Download the skeleton provided in Judge. Do not change the StartUp class or its namespace.
Pay attention to name the project ClothingMagazine, all the classes, their fields and methods the same way they are presented in the following document. It is also important to keep the project structure as described.
2.	Problem Description
Your task is to create a repository that stores clothes by creating the classes described below.
Cloth
You are given a class Cloth with the following properties:
•	Color - string
•	Size - int
•	Type - string
The class constructor should receive color, size and type. 
Override the ToString() method in the following format:
"Product: {type} with size {size}, color {color}"
Magazine
Next, you are given a class Magazine that has Clothes (a List that stores the entity Cloth). All entities inside the repository have the same properties. The Magazine class should have the following properties:
•	Type - string
•	Capacity – int
•	Clothes – List<Cloth>
The class constructor should receive type and capacity, also it should initialize the Clothes with a new instance of the collection. Implement the following features:
•	Method AddCloth(Cloth cloth) – adds an entity to the collection if there is room for it
•	Method RemoveCloth(string color) – removes a cloth by given color, if such exists, and returns boolean (true if it is removed, otherwise – false)
•	Method GetSmallestCloth() – returns the Cloth with the smallest Size
•	Method GetCloth(string color) – returns the Cloth with the given color
•	Method GetClothCount() – returns the number of clothes
•	Method Report() – returns a string in the following format (print the clothes in ordered by Size):
o	"{type} magazine contains:
{Cloth1}
{Cloth2}
(…)"
3.	Constraints
•	The color and size of the clothes will be always unique.
•	You will always have clothes added before receiving methods manipulating the Magazines’ clothes.


4.	Examples
This is an example of how the Magazine class is intended to be used. 
Sample code usage
//Initialize the repository (Magazine)
Magazine magazine = new Magazine("Zara", 20);

//Initialize entity (Cloth)
Cloth cloth1 = new Cloth("red", 36, "dress");

//Print Cloth
Console.WriteLine(cloth1); //Product: dress with size 36, color red

//Add Cloth
magazine.AddCloth(cloth1);

//Remove Cloth
Console.WriteLine(magazine.RemoveCloth("black")); //false

Cloth cloth2 = new Cloth("brown", 34, "t-shirt");
Cloth cloth3 = new Cloth("blue", 32, "jeans");

//Add Cloth
magazine.AddCloth(cloth2);
magazine.AddCloth(cloth3);

//Get smallest cloth
Cloth smallestCloth = magazine.GetSmallestCloth();
Console.WriteLine(smallestCloth); //Product: jeans with size 32, color blue

//Get Cloth
Cloth getCloth = magazine.GetCloth("brown"); //Product: t-shirt with size 34, color brown
Console.WriteLine(getCloth);


Console.WriteLine(magazine.Report());
//Zara magazine contains:
//Product: jeans with size 32, color blue
//Product: t-shirt with size 34, color brown
//Product: dress with size 36, color red
